Overview

snapsend.sh is a robust script designed for ZFS snapshot management, supporting various configurations for local and remote operations, including compression, buffering, and forceful full send in case of incremental send failure.
Modes of Operation

The script supports three distinct modes of operation:

    Local Mode: Transfers snapshots within the same server.
    Remote Backup Mode: Transfers snapshots to a remote backup server.
    Remote Synchronization Mode: Keeps datasets synchronized between local and remote servers.

Script Options

    -m: Custom snapshot prefix.
    -u: Custom SSH user.
    -k: SSH password.
    -p: SSH port (default: 22).
    -R: Recursion for datasets.
    -b: Use mbuffer for buffering.
    -z: Use gzip for compression.
    -f: Force full send if incremental fails.
    -F: Force full send immediately.
    -v: Verbose level (1: minimal, 2: normal, 3: debug).
    usage:
    ./snapsend.sh [-m snapshot_prefix] [-u remote_user] [-k password] [-p remote_port] [-R] [-b] [-z] [-f] [-F] [-v verbose_level] local_datasets remote

    Examples:
Local Mode
./snapsend.sh -m "automated_hourly_" -R -F "hdd/test/hv1" "hdd/kopie"
This command creates and sends snapshots of hdd/test/hv1 to hdd/kopie with recursion and forceful full send.

This command creates and sends snapshots of hdd/test/hv1 to the remote server 192.168.28.8 under /backups using SSH with the specified user and password.

Remote Synchronization Mode
./snapsend.sh -m "automated_hourly_" -R -F -u "root" -k "password" "rpool/data/vm-100-disk-0" "192.168.28.8:/backups"

This command keeps the dataset rpool/data/vm-100-disk-0 synchronized between the local server and the remote server at 192.168.28.8:/backups.
Warnings and Considerations
Using -f and -F

Using -f (force incremental) in combination with -R (recursive) can lead to a full send for all child datasets if an issue occurs with one of them. This can result in long transfer times and high network usage. Use with caution.
Scenario:
Imagine a Proxmox server with multiple large virtual machines. If an admin accidentally deletes the last snapshot for rpool/data/vm-100-disk-0, the target server will have one redundant snapshot. This will prevent an incremental ZFS send. Using the script with ./snapsend.sh -m "automated_hourly_" -R -f "rpool/data/vm-disks" "192.168.28.8:hdd/kopie" will trigger a full ZFS send for all VMs from source to target, after performing zfs destroy hdd/kopie/rpool/data/vm-disks. This can lead to hours of network load and halt the transfer of other snapshots.
